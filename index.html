        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Microsoft builds its Edge web browser to process and execute Javascript efficiently. Microsoft has developed and maintained its own JavaScript engine for Edge, is considering creating an alternative version of NodeJS with the Edge engine, and supports Node on the Azure cloud platform. </li>
                <li>Paypal uses JavaScript in the front end of their website, and NodeJS in the back end for all client-facing applications</li>
                <li>Netflix uses JavaScript and NodeJS in the cloud to break down pieces of their user interface into individual services, alleviating stress on their servers.</li>
                <li>Groupon rebuilt their entire website be breaking down everything into individual NodeJS web applications to operate faster.</li>
                <li>Uber uses JavaScript and NodeJS to handle huge volumes of data in real time, taking advantage of its asynchronous capabilities.</li>
                <li>Facebook is dominantly based on Javascript. Each piece of a webpage is separate. It developed its own way of breaking down and delivering sections of JavaScript separately to represent the webpage as a collection of independent JavaScript application. Facebook also created the front end JS framework React. </li>
                <li>Google search uses JavaScript to display results as your typing. Gmail web client and Google docs also use JavaScript. Google docs uses Closure Tools to compile JavaScript into a lower level faster form. Google developed a JavaScript engine called V8 for its web browser Chrome, which became the basis for NodeJs. Google also created the front end JS framework Angular JS to be used in its DoubleClick ad platform. </li>
                <li>Ebay converted everything to JavaScript and NodeJS, much like Netflix</li>
                <li>Walmart uses JavaScript and NodeJS for its online retail business, and other web applications requiring multiple users to access management interfaces simultaneously</li>

        <h2>A JavaScript Application of Interest</h2>
        <p><a href="http://histography.io/">Histography.io</a> is an interesting site. The use of Wikipedia to populate a highly interactive dot chart timeline looks and feels good from a user perspective, and leads to alot of time spent browsing out of interest. <br><br>
            <a href="https://www.mapstd.com/"> Maps TD </a> is also quite interesting. It uses Google Maps to create a classic Tower Defence game that's quite fun.
